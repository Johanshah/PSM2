Hi developers,

*Note: Please read this before using the scripts provided in this folder

To use the saved values from the 2D running game level editor for a new Unity project,
simply import all the files under the 'Developer Utilities' folder
and don't forget to import the .txt file you want to the Unity project

Then, change variable filename value in 'LoadTxtFile.cs' script to your file name (.txt file) you want to load the data

Open 'Running' scene and drag the 'LoadTxtFile.cs' script to the inspector of 'manager' gameObject

Run the 'Running' scene, and you can see the data from the file you load in the inspector of 'manager' gameObject

Thank you, enjoy your development.
